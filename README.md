# Season-Length-Northern-Hemisphere
 Calculating and Estimating length of the 4 seasons in different regions across the Northern Hemishpere (30-60 deg N)

## Data Source
The daily temperature data files have been downloaded from https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadghcnd/download.html (HadGHCND data)

## Output Files
